# **Project for UCSD's ECE SIPP Hackathon Contest**  

**Problem Addressed**: A common issue that people run into when exercising over several intervals or sets is that people tend to lose track of the current repetition they are on. This often results in them having to redo the exercise or risk skipping a certain number of repetitions.   

**Functionality**: The LED display has the 2 far-left digits displaying the threshold distance and the 2 far-right digits displaying the number of repetitions. As a person approaches the distance sensor within the threshold distance indicated in the display, the passive buzzer will produce a sound indicating that the repetition was validated. Simultaneously, the LED display will increase the repetition value by one. If the person desires to move on to another exercise that requires a different threshold distance, they may use the potentiometer to adjust the necessary distance, which will appear on the display. Once the person completes their exercise, they are able to reset the repetition count to zero by pressing the push button. 

Materials Used:
* 3461BS 4-digit 7-segment LED display
* HCSR04 distance sensor
* B10K potentiometer
* Passive buzzer
* 4-pin push button
* 330 ohm resistors
